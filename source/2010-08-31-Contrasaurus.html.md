Despite all the bold claims I made in 50% of my blog posts, The Wrens are beating me badly at this blog-off. Saying something of value on the internet is a tough job.

The real point of this post isn’t to complain that some band from New Jersey is better than me at typing 5 words every six months, it’s to shamelessly promote an amazing new browser / soon-to-be mobile phone game. It is called Contrasaurus and you can play it <a href='http://contrasaur.us/' target='_blank'>here</a>. Ten points if you can name all the references or explain the plot.

Daniel X. Moore and I have been hard at work on this since early May and we think it’s pretty cool. We are shooting to release the Beta this weekend. I would say check back here for updates be we all know that won’t happen. However, the game’s site IS updated quite frequently, so check there and don’t forget to like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Contrasaurus/101113043274821).
