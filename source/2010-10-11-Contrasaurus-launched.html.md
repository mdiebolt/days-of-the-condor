I am very excited to say that Contrasaurus has been launched!

Head over to [STRd6](http://strd6.com/2010/10/contrasaurus-launch/) for the full post.

This was an awesome learning experience. Working with Daniel X. Moore since dreaming up this ridiculous game this May has been a pleasure.

Big props to Brent Anderson at [Backyard Ninja Design](http://www.dumbmanex.com/bynd_main.html) for the great sprite art and Lana X. Moore at [My Name is Wool](http://mynameiswool.com/) for the awesome backgrounds.

Our next goal is to open source all of the tools we used to create Contrasaurus. We will be putting together a full HTML5 / javascript tool chain for creating your own browser / mobile phone games. Keep [up to date](http://pixieengine.com).
